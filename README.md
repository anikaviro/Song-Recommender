# Song-Recommender
## Project for a song recommender

In this project, we created a function that given a song and its title, if provides with 5 similar songs, based on the audio features of that one. 

For this, we used a machine learning model an da database scraped from the top 100 Billboart songs as well as a 3.5k songs database scraped from the top 100 songs of each year since the 1940s, also according to Billboard. This bigger dataset was scraped from Wikipedia. 

We also used the Spotify API in order to gather the audio features of each song.

Please find here the presentation in PDF as well as the funcions.
